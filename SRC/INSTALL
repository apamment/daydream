Quick install
=============

 - become the superuser

$ su -
[type your root password here]

 - create a group "zipcheck". This is the group ID for the 
   temporary files during the archive validity checking. 

# groupadd zipcheck

 - create a new user "zipcheck" that has "zipcheck" as its primary
   group ID and an invalid shell:

# useradd -g zipcheck -s /bin/false zipcheck

 - create a new user "bbsadmin". You will need this account when
   performing administrative tasks on your board. This user should
   have "bbs" as group and "/home/bbs" as home directory. It should
   also have "zipcheck" in its supplementary group. The password
   should be known only by you.

# groupadd bbs
# useradd -d /home/bbs -m -G zipcheck -g bbs bbsadmin
# passwd bbsadmin
[type any password here]

 - create another user "bbs" with a group "bbs" and a home directory
   "/home/bbs". Remember to set the password as well. You may want
   to choose a complex one for a while and remove the password when
   your board is ready to handle users. This user needs to have 
   "zipcheck" in its supplementary group as well.

# useradd -d /home/bbs -G zipcheck -g bbs bbs 
# passwd bbs
[type any password here]

 - make sure that "/home/bbs" is owned by "bbsadmin" and has
   permissions 750:

# chown bbsadmin:bbs /home/bbs
# chmod 750 /home/bbs

 - now log in as "bbsadmin", create directory "src" and change
   to it:

$ mkdir src
$ cd src

 - Get the daydream etc package and unpack it:

$ unzip daydream-2.15-etc.zip
$ cd INSTALL
$ sh install_me.sh /home/bbs/

 - Get the daydream source package and unpack it:
 
$ unzip daydream-2.15-src.zip
$ cd daydream_src
$ sh make.sh build
$ INSTALL_PATH=/home/bbs/ sh make.sh install

 - If everything works out ok, do

$ cd ~
$ source scripts/ddenv.sh
$ utils/ddcfg daydream.cfg

 - now become the superuser again and execute the script that
   armors the installation, that is, makes the permissions
   and ownerships of files and directories somewhat safer.

$ su -
[type your root password here]
# /home/bbs/src/daydream_src/secure.sh /home/bbs

 - make DayDream's login script a valid shell by adding the
   following line to "/etc/shells":

/home/bbs/scripts/ddlogin.sh

 - change the login shell of "bbs" to "/home/bbs/scripts/ddlogin":

# usermod -s /home/bbs/scripts/ddlogin.sh bbs

 - Finally, see xinetd.howto in the docs directory for enabling xinetd.
   If you are going to allow ssh connections to the bbs, TURN OF SFTP!
   I can't stress this enough!
