Several akas for one netmail directory
--------------------------------------------

Several nodes in FTN networks have several akas,
for example a NC (applies to RC, ZC, etc) may 
have z:x/0, and his own node, for example, z:x/100.
But we want just one netmail area. That is possible
by having the same netmail messagebase twice. E.g.

NetmailArea NETMAIL_1 63:1 -a z:x/0
NetmailArea NETMAIL_1 63:1 -a z:x/100

However we just one of the addresses can be used
for sending mail (normal bbs behaviour). The name
of the area does not matter.

If you are in an othernet too you would need to
have another netmail area for that net, because
of the sender address. For example (first net
z_1, x_1, second net z_2, x_2).

NetmailArea NETMAIL_1 63:1 -a z_1:x_1/0
NetmailArea NETMAIL_1 63:1 -a z_1:x_1/100
NetmailArea NETMAIL_1 64:1 -a z_2:x_2/100

My netmail configuration is the following. I am
in just fidonet (conf 2) and Amiganet (conf 4).

NetmailArea NETMAIL 2:1 -a 2:236/100
NetmailArea NETMAIL 4:1 -a 39:140/100

Passthru areas
--------------------------------------------

Since DD-Echo uses the store-and-forward principle
passthru areas would require several changes to the
code. I have a more simpler solution. 

To create a passthru area. Add a area with a dummy
messagebase. This messagebase should not be used for
anything else than this purpose. Use this messagebase
for all passthru areas, like this (dummy msgbase 64:1)

Conference 63 /path/to/conf/

Area PASSTHRU_1 63:1 -g D -a 2:236/100 2:236/100.1 ...
Area PASSTHRU_2 63:1 -g D -a 2:236/100 2:236/100.1 ...
Area PASSTHRU_3 63:1 -g D -a 2:236/100 2:236/100.1 ...

After tossing AND scanning you should delete all files
in the messagebase, i.e rm /path/to/conf/messages/base001/*
