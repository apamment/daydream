* Flattening a handful of updates into one changelog entry since I've
  clearly failed to maintain this. :)

* Added hint to install 'fromdos' package to help scanning echomail packets

* Added FIDODIR var in fido config to allow more dynamic echomail local
  directory structure

* Fixed upload processor when no diz is found

* Added ddtelnetd IP logging (thanks to Frank Linhares)

* Fixed a bug in ddcallers

* Removed stropts.h references, which were causing broken builds on
  modern systems (this is also just unnecessary)

* Fixed a very hard to diagnose buffer overflow issue in ddcfg. This
  was a simple off by one thing. So frustrating

* Returned HYDRACOM as a built-in file transfer protocol. Note that
  this is untested because I can't find a client that works to test
  this! But it was easy to re-add, so why not.

* Re-added ax2dd - hypothetically this can convert amiexpress and
  sigmaexpress user bases into daydream. Untested (recently)

* Re-added 18to34 which will convert amiga 18 character DD filelists
  into newer 34 character long format

Mon Mar 10 16:50:00 PST 2014

* Moved from privately hosted git repo to github.com/ryanfantus/daydream
  Released as a 2.20.0-RC for now. Code freeze in process. Significant
  rewrite forthcoming!

Fri Jul 19 21:58:00 EST 2013

* Removed all POR code.  This is easily a patch or something, but the original
  developers were kind of opposed to this idea for now (unless we can make
  it REALLY clean).

* Began implementing sexyz 32 bit zmodem/ymodem-g transfers.  This is a beta
  feature and not production.

* Began building SQL support into beta versions

* Registered daydreambbs.com and threw a git repo on there

Tue Nov 22 01:45:00 MST 2011

* Added preliminary glftpd support along the lines of Project Oldskool Revenge.
  Added a lot of code thanks to glAsh.  Temporarily broke the diz checker for
  zmodem and ddftpd uploads.  Hopefully fixed now.

  ** I can't test glftpd - don't have / want it set up on monterey! **
  ** Need glftpd / POR testers!!! **

  ** See file "UPGRADE" !!! **

* Fixed a few install time issues.  Hopefully will run smoother now.

Thu Nov 10 13:46:00 MST 2011

* Added autosig support.  Checks for a file, $DAYDREAM/users/#/autosig.dat
  with # being the user #'s dir.  If found, dded gives option to append
  sig to message.  Also, added a door, "autosig", and a graphics file,
  autosigtop.gfx|txt, for the door.  It is launched by default as option
  #12 in the "A"lter user data from main menu.

Thu Nov 03 21:46:00 MST 2011

* Reimplemented "old" ddftpd.  Back by popular demand.  :)  Complete with
  "SITE UPLOAD #" working.  Woohoo!

Tue Nov 01 12:36:00 MST 2011

* Added some features to the user editor.  Now it has a built in user lister
  with user numbers.  You can search by user number as well.  Also, you may
  scroll back and forth between users with [ and ] keys.

Mon Oct 31 08:52:00 MST 2011

* Added a line to dd-echo.cfg - StrictInboundChecking
  This fixes an issue where dd-echo was being very strict with how it handles
  incoming mail and checking the flags for secure vs insecure, etc.  This is
  a nice feature but impossible to take advantage of if you automate your
  echomail process with bash scripts.  This line, when commented, will allow
  unsecure mail in the secure dirs to still be tossed.

Sat Oct 29 17:46:00 MST 2011

* Fixed an uploading bug.  ddrz would often fail on uploads because of some
  issues with it trying to receive a file before the uploader actually starts
  sending it.  Fixed now.

Fri Oct 28 17:52:00 MST 2011

* Messages now parse |## color codes, renegade style.  May add a cfg option
  for this in the future.  For now, all messages will be parsed, and quoting
  will always remove the pipes.

Fri Oct 7 14:22:00 MST 2011

* Message quoting now truncates anything past column 75.  I'll make an option
  in daydream.cfg later to do the new, truncated way, or the old way.

Thu Oct 6 17:40:00 MST 2011

* Added StripPipes() and implemented it directly after StripAnsi() in the
  message replying option.  This will strip pipe codes from ansis that are
  used in replies.  I plan to parse the color codes for viewing in the future
  but think that it's silly to keep the codes in tact for message replies.

Tue Oct 4 17:01:00 MST 2011

* Daydream like to keep original messages in tact, without truncation of text
  in messages beyond column 79.  Instead, it would reformat messages in an
  ugly fashion to display small chunks on the next line.  This change simply
  truncates all text past column 79.  In the future, I plan to add an option
  in daydream.cfg's message bases, to turn this on or off, additionally I plan
  to make a new method of linewrapping messages and keeping thread integrity.
  This is only a fix for message reading, not yet a fix for responding!

Mon Oct 3 16:05:00 MST 2011

* Added ability to use logoffdoors.dat for logoff, same as logindoors.dat
  during login procedure.  This fixes a bug where some programs wouldn't
  function properly in logoff batch files.  Not sure the reason, but here's
  a workaround anyway.

Thu May 19 21:20:00 MST 2011

* Various BSD fixes implemented by Deuce aka Stephen Hurd.  Fixes to allow
  make instead of gmake on BSD to compile.

* Various pieces of code moved into the config.h for more global availability.
  This is also thanks to Stephen Hurd.

* Also thanks to Stephen Hurd there should be more ddftp/ddftpd compatibility
  across *BSD.

* DDChat can now use '-4' as an argument to listen to a specific address:
  -4 127.0.0.1
  Also, -d runs it daemonized, and there is daemonization code as well.

* secure.sh now looks to username:group instead of username.group.  This has
  not been an issue thus far for anyone that I've dealt with, but now it
  is more standards compliant.

* Lib functions strlcpy, strlcap, setenv, unsetenv, and vasprintf are default
  internal linux C library functions, and daydream was compiling a separate
  function for each into its binaries.  Now it will smartly figure out if it
  needs to make those functions, so there isn't a duplication of efforts.

* Now, in ddlogin.sh, instead of the last line simply launching the daydream
  binary, it'll precede it with 'exec', to free up an instance of sh and
  save some (probably negligeable) overhead :)

Sun May 8 22:48:12 MST 2011

* Fixed dded to not boot users pressing the enter key in the fullscreen
  editor.  This was a simple issue of clearing out the \r's and making
  them all \n's instead.  Thanks to Mercyful Fate for pointing this out and
  helping me test.

* Added docs/xinetd.howto and changed some of the INSTALL.  Now xinetd should
  be straightforward, as well as dealing with permissions issues right
  off the bat.

* Very crudely modified the install script to make a $DAYDREAM/include
  dir and put all the *.h files in there, so that writing daydream doors
  and compiling old daydream doors is that much easier.

Tue Feb 23 16:04:50 CET 2010

* Wrote ddnntp and ddtelnetd. ddtelnetd should utilize the 
  available bandwith when performing zmodem filetransfers.
  I feel that daydream 2.15 is mature enough for release.
  
* Added pausing on select messages / conferences.

Sun Feb 14 02:43:21 CET 2010

* "<esc^> the error I was talking about before with the file listings...
   it seems that the directory.### files aren't being written properly when 
   one file has too long of a .diz, the next file in the list begins with the 
   filename spaced out 6 spaces from the left instead of left justified, 
   which screw up file listing :)"
   
   Fixed! :)
   
* "<esc^> paltas- also I remember you saying something about mmap.  
   I have an interesting bug that I found...if I move all files out of one dir and into another, 
   then scan the original dir (which now has empty directory file) the error is like this:
   Scanning directory #001Cannot mmap();"
   
   Fixed! :)
   
   Thank you esc^.

Tue Feb  9 22:09:57 CET 2010

* Daydream now shows a screenlength and not a screenlength+1

Mon Feb  8 13:35:32 CET 2010

* Fixed a bug in dd-echo, simply forgot to close some files which made
  it crash during to too many open files (I learned that this number
  is 1024).
  
* Fixed a bug in fixbases. If the messagebase was non-existing a random
  number would be in the lastread pointers.

* Rewrote parts of create_directory in order to allow local login from
  "bbsadmin".

Mon May 11 23:05:23 CEST 2009

* Used a lot of time to locate a bug in ddz, it's related to 
memory mapping in ddsz. It works great without memory map support,
so at the moment memory map support will be disabled.

Mon May 11 11:53:18 CEST 2009

* Included muggichat in the source. The only door which is really missing.

* Fixed stdiohan.c such that dosdoors / stdio doors is also snoopable from 
  ddsnoop 

* Fixed a performance loss in stdiohan.c, when running doors daydream used
  25% of my capacity due to non-blocking io with short timeout. The DOS
  doors does actually run faster!
  
* Thought there was a bug related to Zmodem but it was simply syncterm
  which was malfunctioning
